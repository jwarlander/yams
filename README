YAMS - Yet Another Monitoring System

YAMS is designed to be a long term trending system capable of handling large
volumes of data.  It leverages other open source software such as collectd and
Postgres.  There are four main components: SUM, ETL, DW and WUI.

System Under Monitor (SUM)

The SUM is a system that is monitored by collectd.  http://collectd.org/

Extract, Load, Transform (ETL)

The ETL is a custom built application that is specifically designed to
transform collectd JSON formatted data from the write_http module and load it
into a relational database management system.  The custon application is built
with lighttpd (http://www.lighttpd.net/), Redis (http://redis.io/), and FastCGI
(http://www.fastcgi.com/).

Data Warehouse (DW)

The DW is the PostgreSQL relational database management system.
http://www.postgresql.org/

Web User Interface (WUI)

The WUI is an application built on Pylons using Flotr, a JavaScript Plotting
Library.  http://pylonshq.com/ http://solutoire.com/flotr/

See the user guide (yams-user-guide.pdf) for more information on how to use
YAMS.
